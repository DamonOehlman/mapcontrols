# MapControls

The MapControls project is an attempt to create generic mapping controls (zoombars, scalebars, etc) that work with a variety of mapping libraries. The map controls generate [eve](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/eve) events and thus can be wired to most mapping libraries (some adapters are provided out of the box though).

The MapControls library should work with most mapping libraries that embed a map within a standard DOM element.
